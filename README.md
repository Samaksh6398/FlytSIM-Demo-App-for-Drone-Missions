# FlytSIM-Demo-App-for-Drone-Missions
Created two Demo Apps for FlytSIM Simulator, either for two different cases. 


**Case 1**
First case is to make a drone take off at the heifht of 5m ann then follow a square trajectory of 6.5 m side'
In the care I took the global coordinates of a square trajectory of Side 6.5m and made the simulation accordingly in FlytSIM.

**Case 2**
Second case is to make drone take off at the height of 10m and follow the triangular trajectory of side 10m.
For the case also I took the global coordinates of a triangular trajectory with same initial coordinates as in Case 1
